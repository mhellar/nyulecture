                    San Francicso Museum of Modern Art. I'd like to share with two recent projects I've worked on at the
                    museum.

                Conservation of media art is lots of fun and very challenging. Here I've been sitting in a dark gallery for 20 days straight trying to ressurect the electronics of a 25 year old digital artwork.
                I've worked on many digital artworks and I'd like to share a few of those projects with you.

                <aside class="notes">
                    One of the first electronic artworks to feature a live feed in the gallery, Haacke’s News (1969)
                    consists of a real time printed newsfeed. A pile of paper grows as it spills from the printer on the
                    table onto the floor, and visitors are welcome to pick up portions to read. News does not analyze
                    news content but simply delivers it, spewing out stories upon stories.

                    News was acquired in 2008 by SFMOMA with a new version of software. As teletype systems and the
                    networks
                    that inform them no longer exists, the work was adapted to print on a dot matix printer via really
                    simple syndication(RSS) feed.

                    News was to be re-ehxbited at SFMOMA in 2018 fro the Nothing Stable under Heaven show. I was asked
                    to re-write the software as the 2008 version had become obsolete.

                    In this image, a part of the 2018 sofware is shown. 

                    In the rewrite we worked closely with the artists studio, which provided a set of parameters
                    Artist parameters, for example:

                    b) Any printer that produces the news bulletins on paper as they come in, dot matrix or other. In
                    case such paper print-outs can technically no longer be produced in the future, an LED or a
                    comparable presentation could be considered.

                    In the Infinity Engine,Hershman Leeson created a functional replica of a genetics lab in collaboration with well-known scientists. Built of modular units, the flexible and scalable environment can be adapted to different locations and reflects current standards in genetic research. In the cubicles, representations and re-enactments of lab tests are on view and printed scaffolds of noses and ears, microscopes, and other types of scientific equipment.

Wallpaper of hybrid crops and animals and syringes define one room, and another room allows visitors to read files of legal documents related to genetic engineering.
