                    San Francicso Museum of Modern Art. I'd like to share with two recent projects I've worked on at the
                    museum.

                Conservation of media art is lots of fun and very challenging. Here I've been sitting in a dark gallery for 20 days straight trying to ressurect the electronics of a 25 year old digital artwork.
                I've worked on many digital artworks and I'd like to share a few of those projects with you.

                    One of the first electronic artworks to feature a live feed in the gallery, Haacke’s News (1969)
                    consists of a real time printed newsfeed. A pile of paper grows as it spills from the printer on the
                    table onto the floor, and visitors are welcome to pick up portions to read. News does not analyze
                    news content but simply delivers it, spewing out stories upon stories.

                    News was acquired in 2008 by SFMOMA with a new version of software. As teletype systems and the
                    networks that inform them no longer exists, the work was adapted to print on a dot matix printer via really
                    simple syndication(RSS) feed.

                    News was to be re-ehxbited at SFMOMA in 2018 fro the Nothing Stable under Heaven show. I was asked
                    to re-write the software as the 2008 version had become obsolete.

                    The software programming language that the 2008 version of news was written in, called Lasso Professional was a relatively obscure proprietary programming language that would not run on modern operating systems.

                    In this image, a part of the 2018 sofware is shown. 

                    In the rewrite we worked closely with the artists studio, which provided a set of parameters
                    Artist parameters, for example:

                    a) printer should be placed on a simple table that does not draw attention to itself.


                    b) Any printer that produces the news bulletins on paper as they come in, dot matrix or other. In case such paper print-outs can technically no longer be produced in the future, an LED or a comparable presentation could be considered.
                    
                    
                    c) New sources, only in English, from all major centers around the world that affect the political events of the time. Inclusion of sources representing opposing sides of conflicts that have repercussions beyond their respective region. All continents should be represented.
                    
                    
                    d) The 2008 computer program developed for "The Art of Participation: 1950 to Now" will most likely have to be adjusted, as technology develops.

                    As part of the new sofware we added a control panel with that showed a realtime feed of the incoming news with start and stop button that would allow the exhibitons staff to turn the piece on from their mobile phone.

                    At SFMOMA we established a software version control server to securely store the sorce code of sofware based artworks including news.
                    Software verion control is a system to track and store changes to a computer software code or a set of files that follow the development project from beginning to end-of-life. 
                    Wide used in modern sofware development, it really is an ideal system for conservation because it's an achive of the software artwork and all changes that have been made, allowing you to jump to point a change has been made.

                    After the 2018 exhbiton at SFMOMA the work went on loan to the Smithsonian American Art Museum. It was interesting because the registar required that SAAM send a physical computer that I was to prepare and send back. 
                    The mac mini was was a bit older and failed the day before the press preview. 
                    After some negoation, I was able to deliver the code electronically with instructions on how to install it and things were running on a new computer in 2 hours.
                    This was interesting as these electronic mediums allow for different models of loans management and delivery, that perhaps differ from traditonal loan processes

Her work examines identity, surveillance, relationships between humans and technology, equality, censorship, and interactivity. Her

                    In the Infinity Engine,Hershman Leeson created a functional replica of a genetics lab in collaboration with well-known scientists. Built of modular units, the flexible and scalable environment can be adapted to different locations and reflects current standards in genetic research. In the cubicles, representations and re-enactments of lab tests are on view and printed scaffolds of noses and ears, microscopes, and other types of scientific equipment.

                                Julia Scher is an American artist who works primarily with themes of surveillance. She uses a variety of mediums and is most known for her installation art and performance art works. Her work addresses issues of control and seduction.
                                In the last 20 years, her research has explored social control dynamics in public space. The art projects have taken the form of interactive installations, reformulated surveillance, site tours, interventions, performances, photography, writing, net.art, linear video, and sound.
